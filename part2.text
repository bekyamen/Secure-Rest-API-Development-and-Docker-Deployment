1️⃣ Build

Purpose: Compile or prepare your application for testing and deployment.

For Node.js + Docker:

Install dependencies:

npm install


Compile TypeScript (if any) or transpile code. For pure JS, skip.

Check that the app runs without syntax errors.

Build the Docker image (optional for Docker pipelines):

docker build -t customer-app .


Result: A "ready-to-run" version of your app in memory or as a Docker image.

2️⃣ Analyze

Purpose: Inspect the code quality, detect bugs, security issues, or vulnerabilities before packaging.

Typical steps:

Linting: Check for code style issues

npx eslint .


Static analysis: Detect errors in code, type checking (if TS)

Dependency scanning: Detect known vulnerabilities in npm packages

npm audit


Optional: Run test coverage report

npm test


Result: Code quality verified, security issues flagged. Deployment is safe.

3️⃣ Package

Purpose: Prepare your application as a distributable artifact for deployment.

For Node.js apps:

Zip the project (optional)

Or build Docker image:

docker build -t my-org/customer-management:latest .


Include everything needed to run the app: code, dependencies, Prisma client, etc.

Result: A deployable package (Docker image or tarball) that can be deployed anywhere.

4️⃣ Deploy

Purpose: Push your packaged app to the target environment (staging, production).

Steps:

Push Docker image to a registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry):

docker tag customer-app my-org/customer-management:latest
docker push my-org/customer-management:latest


Deploy container to server, Kubernetes, or cloud service:

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env my-org/customer-management:latest


Optional: Run database migrations automatically before starting:

npx prisma migrate deploy


Validate deployment (health checks, smoke tests).

Result: Application is live and running in the target environment.
